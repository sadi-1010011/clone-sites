# clone-sites

A collection of websites hand coded by me to look as closer as the provided websites design and user interface.
There is about four or five websites i have cloned since first commit. New clones will be pushed later through each commit.

#Note

This is to inform you that all the clones are static websites, not only because we cannot host gitHub pages for dynamic sites.
Dynamic functional clone websites will be hosted seperately if interested.

your feedbacks are most welcome...
